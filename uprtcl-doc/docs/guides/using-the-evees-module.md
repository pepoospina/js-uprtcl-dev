# Using the Evees module

If you haven't yet, read the [\_Prtcl spec](https://github.com/uprtcl/spec) to know about the \_Prtcl and its possibilites.

Loading and using the `EveesModule` together with your "data" module has several advantadges:

- It provides **out of the box updating, forking and merging content-addressable data**.
- It provides automatic **version control history**.
- It provides an **updatable hash** by which you can reference content that is self updating.
- [TBD] It will provide automatic signature check.

`Evees` are content-agnostic: each commit can point to any kind of content-addressable entity. This enables the creation of multiple modules that **implement different types of data** to be pointed to from a `Commit`.

Each of these `MicroModules` is independent of one another, although they may import services from any other module. This enables you to **install and load those modules that implement the entities and behaviours that you want to be able to manage in your application**.

Maybe not all content-addressable objects are suitable to be modeled after Evees: we think there is going to be experimentation and diversity until we find what works and what doesn't.

To include `Evees` management in your application, you have to configure and load the `EveesModule` in the `MicroOrchestrator`. You can use this as an example:

```ts
import { MicroOrchestrator } from '@uprtcl/micro-orchestrator';
import { IpfsConnection } from '@uprtcl/ipfs-provider';
import { HolochainConnection } from '@uprtcl/holochain-provider';
import { EthereumConnection } from '@uprtcl/ethereum-provider';
import {
  EveesModule,
  EveesEthereum,
  EveesHolochain,
  EveesBindings,
} from '@uprtcl/evees';

const httpHost = 'http://localhost:3100/uprtcl/1';
const ethHost = '';
const ipfsConfig = { host: 'ipfs.infura.io', port: 5001, protocol: 'https' };

const httpCidConfig = {
  version: 1,
  type: 'sha3-256',
  codec: 'raw',
  base: 'base58btc',
};

const ipfsCidConfig = {
  version: 1,
  type: 'sha2-256',
  codec: 'raw',
  base: 'base58btc',
};

const httpConnection = new HttpConnection();
const ethConnection = new EthereumConnection({ provider: ethHost });

const httpEvees = new EveesHttp(
  httpHost,
  httpConnection,
  ethConnection,
  httpCidConfig
);
const ethEvees = new EveesEthereum(ethConnection, ipfsConfig, ipfsCidConfig);

const evees = new EveesModule([ethEvees, httpEvees], httpEvees);

const orchestrator = new MicroOrchestrator();

await orchestrator.loadModule(evees);
```

## Evees

`Evees` (Evolving Entities) are ever evolving, forking and merging data structures that can live and coevolve in different platforms.

They are made of two basic entities: `Perspectives` (_branches_ in git) and `Commits`. This is the basic GraphQl types that the `EveesModule` registers:

```graphql
type Perspective implements Entity {
  id: ID!

  head: Commit @discover
  name: String
  context: Context
  payload: Payload
  proposals: [UpdateProposal!]

  _context: EntityContext!
}

type Commit implements Entity {
  id: ID!

  parentCommits: [Commit!]! @discover
  timestamp: Date!
  message: String
  data: Entity @discover
  creatorsIds: [ID!]!

  _context: EntityContext!
}
```

You can see the complete schema and all the mutations available [here](https://github.com/uprtcl/js-uprtcl/blob/master/modules/evees/src/graphql/schema.ts).

## Using Evees

After loading the `EveesModule` and all its dependencies, and also the [any of the available "data" modules](/modules/modules/uprtcl-documents) you want to include, all the infrastructure is set for you to declare any custom element defined in any of those modules inside your web application:

```html
<body>
  <module-container>
    <!-- Any kind of custom element defined in the modules or in your app is available here -->
    <wiki-drawer .uref="${perspectiveId}"></wiki-drawer>
  </module-container>
</body>
```

You can see our [simple-editor demo](https://github.com/uprtcl/js-uprtcl/tree/develop/demos/simple-editor) for a small usage of the `EveesModule`.

## Using `<cortex-entity>`

There is a special built-in custom element defined in [`@uprtcl/lenses`](https://uprtcl.github.io/js-uprtcl/modules/packages/uprtcl-lenses.html): `<cortex-entity>`.

This element takes as an **input a `uref` (_entity reference_) value**, and is able to:

1. **Fetch the entity** with the given entity reference identified with the given hash from the registered `CASSources`.
2. **Recognize which behaviours** does the object implement, and in particular which `lenses` are registered.
3. Picks and **renders a lens** to display the given object.

In practice, this makes `<cortex-entity>` a **dynamic rendering engine**, in which the instantiator of the element **doesn't need to know anything about the entity they want to render** other than have access to its reference.

> In the future, the possibility of adding new kinds of entity references or links will be enabled. This means that you will be able to define different kind of "links" from one content-addressable entity to another in your system or application.

## Building a "data" module for Evees

Refer to [Developing a Cortex Module](/guides/cortex/what-is-cortex) to know how to fully develop a cortex module for your data structures. The additional steps needed to integrate your entities with `Evees` are:

- Implement the [Merge behaviour](https://github.com/uprtcl/js-uprtcl/blob/master/modules/evees/src/behaviours/merge.ts) for all entities that can be referenced from a Commit ([example](https://github.com/uprtcl/js-uprtcl/blob/master/modules/documents/src/patterns/text-node.pattern.ts)).
- Implement the [HasChildren behaviour](https://github.com/uprtcl/js-uprtcl/blob/develop/packages/cortex/src/behaviour/has-links.ts) for all entities that can be referenced from a Commit, returning the list of hashes that reference "children" entities ([example](https://github.com/uprtcl/js-uprtcl/blob/master/modules/wikis/src/patterns/wiki.entity.ts)).
- Register all necessary [CASSources](/guides/cortex/building-blocks/sources) to be able to retrieve all your entities.
- [Create a GraphQl schema](/guides/cortex/building-blocks/graphql-schemas) extension in which your data types implement the `Entity` type.

## List of built-in modules with compatible with Evees

- [`@uprtcl/documents`](/modules/modules/uprtcl-documents): implements `TextNode` entities and a general purpose text-editor that is updated throught Evees.
- [`@uprtcl/wikis`](/modules/modules/uprtcl-wikis): implements `Wiki` entities and a wiki drawer to contain multiple documents.
