# Overview

Here are detailed all the [NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40uprtcl) released to date, organized by functionality:

- `@uprtcl/micro-orchestrator`: as the base package that manages loading modules and their dependencies.
- **Bootstrap modules**: reusable cortex modules that implement different functionalities and entity domains.
- **Backend providers**: _Prtcl wrappers around common (de)centralized platforms to make it easier to integrate by cortex modules.
- **Infrastructure**: base `MicroModules` that make all other functionality work.
- **Other modules**: modules that are not built directly by the _Prtcl organization: community modules, etc.
